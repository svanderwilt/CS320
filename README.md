Sofware Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance 

I can ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure by utilizing the techniques learned in this class such as manual testing or JUnit testing and other functional and non-functional testing methods.

I interpret the users needs by making sure that I undertstand the requirements and get clarificication wherever needed.  I incorporate them into a program by merging the needs of the stakeholder and the end user.

I approach designing software by breaking the requirements down into smaller parts that can be tested independently.  Once I have successfully tested those parts I start incorporating them together and make sure that I am tesing along the way.
